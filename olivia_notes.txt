Olivia notes to Andrew 2022-07-24

Python file names:
- there should be no spaces in your python filenames
- this is good practice because spacing could be messed up by a user who accidentally presses 2 spaces or forgets

new stuff.py --> new_stuff.py
button test.py --> button_test.py

or even having a folder called test/ that you use to make small scripts to test single functions

README.md
- it is important to fill this out ahead of starting a project
- your readme tells users how to run your code
- in your case, there should be a line in the readme that says "type python Lacti_data_viewer.py" to start the app
- it can also tell me behavior is expected with screenshots
- Readmes are great to complete *FULLY* with examples because they are also what people who don't code look at

STYLE
- keep your text under 80 characters on each line -- you can add this in vscode so you see a faint line at
80 characters -- good practice for sharing code
- remove the spaces between "=" in setting function parameters
- they're ok outside of parenthesis like in variable assignment
